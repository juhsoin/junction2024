C1001	Connection Report Issue	This seems like a complex case where the disconnection request overlaps with a new agreement. To fix this, maybe we need to manually clear the disconnection request from the system before reattempting to log the connection on 6.6.2022. Has anyone tried updating the system status manually?

C1002	Manual Override Required	I've had similar issues before. I recommend reaching out to DataHub support to check if they can manually override the disconnection request for this accounting point. Sometimes, they can clear it on their end when system errors block updates.	U9101	1699505400	1699505400	1
C1003	System Workflow Conflict	I believe the problem here is due to an open request blocking subsequent status updates. Perhaps we should create an escalation to have this workflow reviewed in the system to prevent future issues. If we can’t clear the open disconnection, balance settlement might also be impacted.

C1004	Seeking Update on DataHub Action	Has DataHub responded? We might need a procedural workaround if this kind of overlap isn’t resolvable by clearing requests. Temporary disconnections can affect reporting accuracy, so we should clarify with them if this approach will consistently resolve these errors.	U5678	1699512600	1699512600	1
