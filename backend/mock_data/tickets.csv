Tämä aiheuttaa tämä tilanteita, joissa asiakas ei näe kulutustietojaan online-palveluissa, ennen kuin myyjä saa tehtyä sopimuksen uudestaan. Tämä korostuu erityisesti nyt, kun toivotaan, että uusi myyjä aloittaa myyntinsä jopa takautuvasti tilanteissa, joissa nykyisen myyjän toiminta päättyy. Sen lisäksi, että tämä asia näkyy loppuasiakkaille, tämä virhe on todella työllistävä, niin käyttöönoton jälkeen olemme kiertotien mukaisesti ”kikkailleet” tuhansia ja tuhansia sopimuksia ja osassa tarvinneet operaattorinkin apua, sillä välillä verkkosopimus on päätettävä takautuvastikin.

95	CSUSE0068498	"""Hello, parties acting in the DSO role face significant challenges in maintaining Datahub authorization processes in the current model. In many situations, MSCONS message traffic has been utilized to simplify maintenance.

Currently, we have nearly 500 separateaxchange point measurements for parties XXX, YYY, and ZZZ, with most falling under our own measurement responsibility. Additionally, there are several exchange points authorized to us where we do not act in the DSO role. We need measurement data from these authorized exchange points for customer billing and network operation and monitoring modeling. Furthermore, we have also authorized multiple exchange points to third parties for similar reasons or when an external service provider supports the non-measurement-responsible counterpart DSO role in the opposite network, allowing them access to measurement data from Datahub without authorization.

Here are our proposed development ideas regarding exchange point authorization processes, which may partially apply to conventional accounting points as well. To our knowledge, WWW has drafted proposals related to the top three points, and some of the existing authorization process improvement suggestions may overlap with these themes:

1) Authorization for an exchange point should be possible retroactively, e.g., up to 90 days in the past.
2) Authorization for an exchange point should cover longer time periods than the current maximum of 1 year, such as up to 3 years at a time or until further notice (for an unspecified duration).
3) Authorization for an exchange point should be extendable before it expires. For example, if there are only 32 days left, but we want to extend it until the end of the year (+120 days).
4) Non-measurement-responsible networks should be able to give authorizations (I’m unsure if this is already possible via CMS).
5) Authorized parties should be able to view structural and measurement data for exchange points through Datahub’s CMS interface.
6) Management of exchange  point authorizations should be available in a dedicated module within Datahub’s user interface. This module would display all market participant interface points and their active authorizations. It would also show exchaneg points authorized by another market party. This makes it easy to track authorization validity for different parties and add new authorizations.
7) If the above option is not feasible, consider implementing a new report in Datahub. This report would allow market parties to see all active authorizations for their exchange points and those authorized to them. The report should include at least the interface point’s GSRN identifier, station code, authorized measurements (e.g., consumption + losses), authorization validity, party identifier, party name, etc.
8) If an authorization is about to expire, a notification should be sent to both the granting and receiving parties 7 days in advance."""	4				"""Hello, parties acting in the DSO role face significant challenges in maintaining Datahub authorization processes in the current model.
